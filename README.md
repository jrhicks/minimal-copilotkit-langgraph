## Project Structure

This monorepo contains 3 interconnected projects that work together to demonstrate CopilotKit and LangGraph integration:

- `react-client`: The frontend React application
- `copilot-runtime-service`: The CopilotKit runtime service
- `lang-graph-service`: The LangGraph agent service

All projects can be installed and run from the root directory using pnpm workspace commands.
